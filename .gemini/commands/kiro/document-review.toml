# Spec Document Review

Review specification documents for consistency, identify contradictions, gaps, and ambiguities, then generate a comprehensive report.

**Output Language**: Follow the language configuration in GEMINI.md or the project's default language.

## Target Feature

Feature name: `{{args}}`

## Validate

Verify review target exists:

- Verify `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/` exists
- Verify at least one of the following exists:
  - `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/requirements.md`
  - `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/design.md`
  - `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/tasks.md`

If validation fails, inform user that the specification does not exist.

## Collect Documents

### Spec Documents

Collect all `.md` and `.json` files from `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/` directory:

- `spec.json` - Spec configuration
- `requirements.md` - Requirements definition
- `design.md` - Technical design
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks
- `research.md` - Research findings (if exists)
- `STATUS.md` - Status (if exists)
- Other markdown files

### Steering Documents

Collect all `.md` files from `.kiro/steering/` directory:

- `product.md` - Product context
- `tech.md` - Technology stack
- `structure.md` - Project structure
- Other custom steering documents

## Review Process

Conduct review from the following perspectives:

### 1. Spec Document Consistency Check

**Requirements ↔ Design Alignment**:

- All requirements covered in Design
- Design features traced back to requirements
- Requirement ID traceability

**Design ↔ Tasks Alignment**:

- All Design components reflected in Tasks
- Task implementation items consistent with Design
- Technology choice consistency

**Design ↔ Tasks Completeness Check**:

- All UI components defined in Design have corresponding Tasks
- Tasks mentioning "UI連携" or "設定UI" have matching UI component definitions in Design
- Requirements containing "設定", "オプション", "UI" keywords have corresponding UI components in Design
- All service interfaces in Design have implementation tasks
- All data types/models in Design have definition tasks

**Acceptance Criteria → Tasks Coverage (CRITICAL CHECK)**:

This check ensures every acceptance criterion has concrete implementation tasks, not just preparation tasks.

1. Extract all criterion IDs from requirements.md (format: X.Y, e.g., 7.1, 7.2)
2. For each criterion:
   - Find corresponding task(s) in tasks.md
   - Classify each task as **Infrastructure** (preparation) or **Feature** (implementation)
   - Verify user-facing criteria have Feature tasks

**Red Flags to Report as CRITICAL**:

| Pattern | Problem | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Criterion → Infrastructure only | Preparation ≠ Implementation | 7.1 → "共有化する" only |
| Criterion → Container task | No concrete work defined | 7.1 → "4." without subtasks |
| Criterion → Generic reference | Unverifiable coverage | 7.1 → "全SharedComponents" |
| Multiple criteria → Same task | Likely incomplete | 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 → all "Task 4" |
| Criterion → No task | Complete omission | 7.4 → (not found) |

**Task Type Definitions**:
- **Infrastructure**: "Create structure", "Extract to shared/", "Define types", "Set up config"
- **Feature**: "Implement view displaying...", "Add panel with...", "Create UI with..."

**Integration Test Coverage (CRITICAL CHECK)**:

When Design.md contains cross-boundary communication (IPC, events, store sync):

| Check | Validation | Report if Missing |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| IPC Liaison | Integration test tasks exist for IPC channels | CRITICAL: IPC integration test missing |
| Store Sync | Tasks exist to verify state propagation | CRITICAL: Store sync test missing |
| Event Chains | Tasks verify full event lifecycle | WARNING: Event chain verification missing |

**Safety Check**:
- If integration tests are theoretically impossible or skipped, is there an explicit **Fallback Strategy** (e.g., E2E test task, detailed manual verification log task)?
- If NO test and NO fallback: **CRITICAL**

**Refactoring Integrity Check (CRITICAL)**:

When design.md indicates replacement or deprecation:

| Check | Validation | Report if Missing |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Deletion Tasks | Tasks exist to physically DELETE old files | CRITICAL: "Facade refactoring" - old files will remain |
| Consumer Updates | Tasks exist to update all import paths in consumer files | CRITICAL: Integration incomplete - old imports persist |
| No Parallel Implementation | Tasks replace (not add alongside) existing files | CRITICAL: Zombie code - new facade without old file removal |

**Anti-Patterns to Flag as CRITICAL**:
- Design says "replace X" but tasks only create new Y without deleting X
- Design says "unify stores" but tasks create facade without updating consumers
- Tasks mention "新規作成" for refactoring without corresponding "削除" tasks
- Multiple files will exist for same responsibility after implementation

**Cross-Document Contradiction Detection**:

- Terminology inconsistencies
- Numeric/specification conflicts
- Dependency misalignments

### 2. Gap Detection

**Technical Considerations**:

- Error handling coverage
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Scalability
- Testing strategy
- Logging (see steering/logging.md)

**Operational Considerations**:

- Deployment procedures
- Rollback strategy
- Monitoring/logging
- Documentation updates

### 3. Ambiguity Extraction

- Vague descriptions
- Undefined dependencies
- Pending decisions
- External integration details

### 4. Steering Alignment Check

**Existing Specification Conflicts**:

- Architecture compatibility
- Technology stack/convention compliance
- Naming convention/directory structure adherence

**Integration Concerns**:

- Impact on existing features
- Shared resource conflicts
- API compatibility

**Migration Considerations**:

- Data migration requirements
- Phased rollout planning
- Backward compatibility

## Generate Report

Determine review number:

1. Search for `document-review-*.md` files in `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/`
2. Get maximum existing review number
3. Determine next sequential number (start with `1` if none exist)

Report file: `.kiro/specs/{{args}}/document-review-{n}.md`

### Report Structure

```markdown
